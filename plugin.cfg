description="A super easy and flexible PDA implementation. 
A PDA is basically a finite state machine with a stack. 
Just add the Machine node and fill in the export options. 
To add a new state, create a new script.
The script  can inherit anything, just use one of the templates. I recommend starting with the tutorial one. 
For animations to work, just add a dependency of type AnimationPlayer. 
The state buffer ensures that the stack never grows too large. (Just a buffer_size of 3 should be enough tho)
You can reference your dependencies (nodes in the scene tree) with snake_case and name them in PascalCase as it is the godot convention. 
Your states will be called same as your scripts, use PascalCase. "
